# Facebook Post Downloader

## Instructions 説明

Steps to download posts:
1. Use `facebook_post_scraper.py`. This downloads post text and post metadata (NOT image and video of posts), and outputs posts in .csv and .json formats. Follow `Options 選項` section below to answer questions the script ask you.
2. **THEN** use `facebook_post_download_imgs_and_vids.py`, which downloads images and videos of posts. You **MUST** use `facebook_post_scraper.py` first before using this script, as this script requires the .json file that `facebook_post_scraper.py` generates.


## Options 選項
### facebook_post_scraper.py (script #1)
The script will ask you these questions:

**1. FB username of page to download. Look at the URL of a profile page to determine.**

  * For example:
    * 立場新聞's username is "standnewshk", as its page's URL is https://www.facebook.com/standnewshk/
    * 人民力量's username is "peoplespower", as its page URL is https://www.facebook.com/peoplespower/

**2. Download all posts?**
* If you want to download ALL posts of a particular page, even if you may have previously downloaded some posts on this page (from a previous backup), press Y. This will take longer.
* If you are ok to download only NEW posts that you have not backed up before, press N.
  * The script keeps track of the date of the newest post it has downloaded in the past.

**3. Enter pagination link**
* This is for advanced users. Please leave blank, unless you have a very specific use for this.
* Specific use case: FB API returns [pagination links](https://github.com/kevinzg/facebook-scraper/issues/336#issuecomment-860289559), which you can use to resume an aborted backup.

**4. Enter path to save posts in**
* Example: C:/users/hk/backup/
* can leave blank if you want to save backup in the folder this script is in

**5. Allow extra requests**
* This is for advanced users. Enter "N" unless you know what you are doing.
* Allowing extra requests will get you temporarily banned from FB API much faster, but may allow you to get post reactions.
* See here for [more info](https://github.com/kevinzg/facebook-scraper#optional-parameters)

**6. Use FB account cookies**
* Recommended to enter "Y". Otherwise FB API will ban you much quicker.
* If "Y" entered, you need to extract FB cookies for script to use, see ["cookies" section here](https://github.com/kevinzg/facebook-scraper#optional-parameters) for instructions.

**7. Use Proxy**
* If you want to use proxy, update PROXY variable in script before running.

**8. Print debugging statements**
* Y for yes, N for No. Can use "N" in most cases.


### facebook_post_download_imgs_and_vids.py (script #2)
**1. Enter username of page you want to download post image/video for**

**2. Enter path to a posts JSON file generated by script #1.**
* This JSON file MUST have been generated within past 12-24 hours, otherwise downloads will not work, as Facebook image URLs [change regularly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30477877/facebook-image-url-gets-expired). 
* If you get errors when downloading image/video, then rerun script #1 first to get an updated .json file, then rerun script #2.
