Here is **.txt and .csv files that contain all links for a Youtube channel, or for a FB page.**

## Notes:

1. `fb_vid` files are all the FB video links for a FB page.
2. Some `.csv` files are separated with semicolon `;` instead of comma `,` This is because some video titles contain a comma `,` which would cause formatting issue with `.csv` file.
